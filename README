Lua::API
========

Lua is a simple, expressive, extension programming language that is
easily embeddable.  Lua::API module provides Perl bindings to Luaâ€™s
C-based embedding API.  It allows Perl routines to be called from Lua
as if they were written in C, and allows Perl routines to directly
manipulate the Lua interpreter and its environment.  It presents a
very low-level interface (essentially equivalent to the C interface),
so is aimed at developers who need that sort of access.

INSTALLATION

This package requires Lua 5.1.X libraries and headers.  On most modern
*nix systems which uses pkg-config, the following will work:

   perl Makefile.PL

If this fails to find the library, specify the location of the
includes and library as follows:

   perl Makefile.PL LUA_INC=-I/my/include/dir LUA_LIBS='-L/my/lib/dir -llua'

Note that on systems which support multiple versions of lua, the
include directory and library name may contain the version


   perl Makefile.PL \
   		   LUA_INC=-I/usr/include/lua5.1 \
   		   LUA_LIBS='-llua5.1'


If this part is successful:

   make
   make test
   make install
